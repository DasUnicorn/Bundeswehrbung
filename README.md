# Bundeswehrbung
A project to analyse the vocabulary and word frequency of the German Military advert series "Die Rekruten".

The series first aired in nov 2016 on YouTube and contains 62 episodes (plus specials). It follows a group of recruits completing the basic military training to attract more people into military duty. Different spin-off series followed.

The series was criticised for it's portraying of the basic training as adventurous and fun, but missing responsibilities and seriousness.
